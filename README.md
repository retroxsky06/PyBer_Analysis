# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide an analysis and visual summary of PyBer's ride-sharing data by city type (Rural, Suburban, and Urban), exploring comparisons and potential trends.  Business recommendations are provided to address potential disparities among the city types.

## Software
Python 3.8, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook

## Results
### Overview of PyBer Findings
This analysis is categorized by three city types: Rural, Suburban, and Urban. The figure below highlights the company's total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

### Rural
The data highlights that Rural cities on average have fewer total rides, drivers and fares compared to Suburban and Urban cities. Despite this finding, it is revealed that due to a low supply of drivers, the average fare prices in Rural areas are the highest among the three city types, as it stands at $34.62.

### Suburban

### Urban
The majority of PyBer's clientele and drivers are located in Urban cities, which in turn, the diagram below showcases that more than half (62.7%) of PyBer's total fares occur in those areas.  It is shown that Urban cities have thirty times more drivers than Rural citites compared to only having five times more drivers than Suburban areas.  With further examination, due to the surplus of Urban city drivers, the average fare per driver is $16.57, ranking this average at the lowest amongst the three city types.

### Total Weekly Fares by City Type

The comparison of total weekly fares between the city types, runnning from January 1,2019 to April 29, 2019 are represented by the multi-line chart below.  The profit amongst the three city types seems fairly consistent.  The total fares for each city are as follows: Rural cities ranged between $0 to $500, Suburban cities ranged between $600 to $1,500, and Urban cities ranged between $1,500 to $2,500.

## Summary and Recommendations

This analysis provided an opportunity to gain further insight on PyBer's business performance in Rural, Surburban, and Urban cities.  It was found that Rural cities are disproportionately affected by higher fare prices and lower options for drivers compared to Suburban and Urban cities.  The higher Rural prices seem inequitable to customers and may be unappealing to potential clientele. More drivers are needed in the Rural cities in order to lower fare prices in these areas.  To combat this disparity, it is recommended that PyBer offers incentives for current and new drivers to service Rural citites.  Additionally, PyBer may bolster job recuitment efforts in Rural citites to attract potential drivers.

Although increasing drivers in Rural areas may be necessary for the growth of PyBer's business, PyBer will need to be careful to not attain an excess of drivers as Urban cities have shown that with a surplus of drivers, the average driver fare will drastically decline.  As there are several ride-sharing contenders, it is imperative that PyBer remains competitive with their driver fare prices to attract and retain drivers.  It is recommended that PyBer strengthen their marketing strategies to increase their visibility to consumers, as well as provide incentives, such as customer discounts and sale promotions (e.g. Ride with PyBer 5 times, receive $10 credit).  With the implementation of these strategies, PyBer will be able to grow and expand their business.
