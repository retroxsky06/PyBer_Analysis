# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide an analysis and visual summary of PyBer's ride-sharing data by city type (Rural, Suburban, and Urban), exploring comparisons and potential trends.  Business recommendations are provided to address potential disparities among the city types.

## Software
Python 3.8, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook

## Results
### Overview of PyBer Findings
This analysis is categorized by three city types: Rural, Suburban, and Urban. The figure below highlights the company's total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

### Rural
The data highlights that Rural cities on average have fewer total rides, drivers and fares compared to Suburban and Urban cities. Despite this finding, it is revealed that due to a low supply of drivers, the average fare prices in Rural areas are the highest among the three city types, as it stands at $34.62.

### Suburban
